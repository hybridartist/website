								<h2>NYC Mayor's Office</h2>
								<p>Service Designer and Researcher</p>
							</header>
							<p>
								Bridging the digital divide is a major goal of Mayor Bill de Blasioâ€™s vision for New York City. The broadband initiative included the rollout of free broadband internet service at NYCHA housing developments. As part of the Innovation and Design Team I researched and designed services for the pilot at the Queensbridge houses.

									<h3>Research</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									Field research included user and expert interviews, field observations, and service safaris. I created empathy maps, journey maps, and comparative analyses.

									Our synthesis of the research translated findings into actionable insights and enhancement ideas for the research report.

									<h3>Prototyping</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									Once a new user signed up they would be directed to a splash page customized for Queensbridge residents. Our user research informed what designs and content types would be most useful and accessible for our user group which has a wide range of ages and digital proficiency. We created paper prototypes, tested and iterated on the designs ensuring we designed with and not for users.

									<h3>Service Bluprint</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									As I gathered requirements for the new service to be implemented, it became clear that a service blueprint was the best tool to envision how the entire system worked from a customer experience and operational perspective. I created a service blueprint template in spreadsheet format so all team members could contribute without requiring design skills.

									Then I began mapping out the service with post-it notes, isolating fail points in the system as well as identifying assumptions and information that needed to be confirmed.

									The service blueprint provides an operational overview of the service aligned to the user experience. Customer touchpoints and back-stage processes are outlined with enough detail to verify, implement and maintain it.

									The Queensbridge Connected project served as a pilot for a new Service Design Lab that would work across City agencies to improve services for low and middle-income individuals. I developed a stakeholder map for the Lab in various roles in internal design consulting, design procurement, developing design tools, and community empowerment. I also created design templates and compiled a knowledge base of research methodologies and tools and presented them to the team.
