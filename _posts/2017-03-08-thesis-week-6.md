		<h4>Activity System Prototype</h4>
	</header>
		<p>
			My first prototype for my toolkit is an Activity System (Engestrom 1987) which provides a theoretical framework for describing the structure and context of human activity.

			I printed out two  11x17 posters to show at demo day, one as a template and the other as a case study in a smart home. I want to solicit feedback for the template itself and show the activity system in action with a case study using traditional design working tools - post-its and sharpies - to arrange and rearrange the various actors in the system. As our demo attendees are designers themselves I want to ask them: Have you worked on any projects where this tool might be useful? What kinds of environments, products, or services could you imagine designers using this tool? What other kinds of tools might be useful in the toolkit? What other types of designers and disciplines might be interested in participating in my research?

		<h4>Branding</h4>
	</header>
		<p>
			I made a first attempt at branding my toolkit of design methods. The working title is Smart Design Toolkit, since the term ‘smart’ is often used in describing new IoT environments such as smart homes, smart buildings, smart cities, etc. I chose not to use the term ‘user experience’ since the design of interactive spaces is a multidisciplinary endeavor and hopefully designers from various fields may find these methods useful without knowing what UX means. I’m not particularly attached to the font or color of the logo so I look forward to getting feedback on that from demo attendees.

		<h4>Meeting Notes</h4>
	</header>
		<p>
			In my Thesis Advisor meeting we discussed my outreach strategy for research participants. As this is a toolkit by and for designers, I will primarily interview designers on their current research and design methods and areas for future development in the successful design of IoT environments. I have one smart home user willing to participate to provide a case study, and while any additional case studies would add to the project they are not the focus.

			This week’s Thesis Accountability Partner meeting was helpful in validating my prototype and revising my research claim: I am researching design methods to address the lack of human-centered design in smart home environments. I think my research will lead to a new toolkit of design methods for smart homes. That’s important because smart home products and services will be better designed to fit the diverse needs of people in domestic contexts.
