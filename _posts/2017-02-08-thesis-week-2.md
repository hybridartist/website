			This week I…
				<li>looked into applying for an IRB for my research now that I have decided my methods and intention for publication. I was relieved to discover this was not required since the focus of my research was not ‘about’ individuals and therefore not considered human subjects research as stated on the <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/content/dam/nyu/research/documents/IRB/IRBDecisionTree.pdf" target ="blank">IRB decision tree</a> : "The focus of the project is only on products, methods, policies, procedures, organizations: e.g. interviewing transportation staff and officials about parking or transportation policies and procedures." </li>
				<li>Continued contextual research on the Internet of Things</li>
				<li>Researched relevant frameworks</li>
				<li>Met with my Thesis Advisor and created an advisor agreement for the semester</li>
				<li>Met with my Thesis Accountability Partners and shared feedback on our projects</li>

			<a href="http://www.iausdj.ac.ir/vet/Documents/@modiriran%20%20the%20internet%20of%20things.pdf" target ="blank">Internet of Things: Legal Perspectives</a> does not appear to offer any helpful, innovative, or frankly realistic to the way these technologies are being rapidly deployed into the environment. The text uses vague language about users without defining who these people are, but makes it clear the capacities they should have which confirms my suspicion of burden shifting to the user:
			<blockquote cite="http://www.iausdj.ac.ir/vet/Documents/@modiriran%20%20the%20internet%20of%20things.pdf">Accountability should also extend to the monitoring stages of a project’s realization and empower the development of effectiveness through user participation. Different kinds of capacities need to be made available in order to meaningfully improve participation during a decision-making process, namely (i) the ability to understand and criticize technical issues, (ii) sufficient knowledge on the given structures and potentials, and (iii) the skills necessary to negotiate with more powerful actors. Therefore, respective assistance to users – in particular the responsible entities within companies – has to be provided by the competent body.</blockquote>

The most notable risk to users is privacy, even for people who aren’t active ‘users’ of an IoT service.

This potentially enables a surveillance mechanism that would pervade large parts of our lives.</blockquote>
			<blockquote cite="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Luigi_Atzori2/publication/222571757_The_Internet_of_Things_A_Survey/links/546b36df0cf2f5eb180914e5/The-Internet-of-Things-A-Survey.pdf">It follows that the IoT really represents an environment in which privacy of individuals is seriously menaced in several ways. Furthermore, while in the traditional Internet problems of privacy arise mostly for Internet users (individuals playing an active role), in the IoT scenarios privacy problems arise even for people not using any IoT service.</blockquote>

			<a href="https://fas.org/irp/nic/disruptive.pdf" target ="blank">Disruptive Civil Technologies: Six Technologies with Potential Impacts on US Interests Out to 2025</a> outlines four different scenarios for adoption of these technologies and how they may affect users as well as US society as a whole. This analysis has interesting insights on the political impacts of mass surveillance and the manufacture of IoT as weapons in a new information age war.
			<blockquote cite="https://fas.org/irp/nic/disruptive.pdf">Individuals, businesses, and governments are unprepared for a possible future when Internet nodes reside in such everyday things as food packages, furniture, paper documents, and more. Today’s developments point to future opportunities and risks that will arise when people can remotely control, locate, and monitor everyday things.</blockquote>
			<blockquote cite="https://fas.org/irp/nic/disruptive.pdf">Thus, massively parallel sensor fusion may undermine social cohesion if it proves to be fundamentally incompatible with Fourth-Amendment guarantees against unreasonable search. By 2025, social critics may even charge that Asia’s dominance of the manufacturing of things—and the objects that make up the Internet of Things—has funded the remilitarization of Asia, fueled simmering intra-Asian rivalries, and reduced US influence over the course of geopolitical events.</blockquote>

			After the writing workshop last week I took a deep dive into <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cambridge-Introduction-Jacques-Introductions-Literature/dp/0521682819" target ="blank">The Cambridge Introduction to Jacques Derrida</a> to check out if deconstruction could be a relevant framework for my thesis. Derrida’s theory of deconstruction questions subtle hierarchies in language that are unjustified. He argues that we need to embrace aporia, a philosophical state of puzzlement, and that doubt or confusion can be useful rather than putting all our faith in logocentrism. While I found his work interesting and perhaps a good approach to life’s complexities and ambiguities, I think it’s a bit off the path I want to take this thesis.

		<h4>Meeting Notes</h4>
	</header>
		<p>
			I met with Dana for our Thesis Advisor meeting and we created an agreement outlining goals and a timeline for the semester. We discussed the pivot in my research question and Dana had valuable insight on related areas to explore. She supported the idea of visualizing an ecosystem and suggested I look further into ecosystems and at systems engineering to inform my approach. She also asked good questions about what’s driving this other than technological enablement, and perhaps looking at past systems and specific case studies would help build my argument.

			This week’s Thesis Accountability Partner meeting was quite productive for all three of us. Fang suggested that my interview questions should attempt to discover pain points in the design process. Identifying these pain points would help define the problem space and could further specify my research question. Tatiana asked a good question about how to articulate augmented virtuality (AV) and look into examples of AV to explore in my research. She also suggested that while the target audience may be designers or technologists more directly involved in making UX decisions around these technologies, it would be useful to interview a wider range of stakeholders including strategists, innovation leadership and users themselves.
