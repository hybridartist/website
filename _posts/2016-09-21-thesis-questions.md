		<h4>Critical Reading and Writing</h4>

			In my research on Topic 1, information overload, I came across studies of the effects of information overload and how to structure communication systems to avoid it. A lot of this research is quantitative and focuses on impacts on performance. I found myself more interested in qualitative findings and cultural impacts. I’ve read articles on digital affordances that lure users into further use and perhaps with more time to dig I could find some academic research related to it.

			I was surprised to find research on Topic 2: human-machine symbiosis was all over the place. However once I started it made sense that people are trying to achieve different types of symbiosis: with the human body through wearable technologies; with the human mind through enhanced learning and memory capacity; and with the machines themselves created in a human likeness. While my original research interest was to investigate human adaptation to new technologies, the research I came across focused on how to create technologies with the goal of symbiosis. For this topic I will need to narrow it down to one of the three types of human-machine symbiosis, and then do more digging on more theoretical and cultural analyses of the quest for this type of symbiosis.
		</p>

			Research on Topic 3 lead to the discovery of some exciting work being done by user experience designers, computer scientists, architects, and human-computer interaction researchers. I learned that “ubiquitous computing” is the appropriate academic term for connectivity in our environment rather than the awful “Internet of Things” used in industry. I enjoyed reading research addressing the problem of the digital and physical divide and proposing hybrid interactions and ecologies. However each academic discipline seems to be approaching the topic very differently and solving for different problems. I suspect the research on workplace collaboration is a result of globalization and companies wanting to improve communication across their offices, work on community participation for social networking, and research on ambient displays to make architecture an interface between people and digital information. This topic has interesting interdisciplinary precedents as well as a lot of room to grow.

		<h4>Rework the Three Step Formula</h4>
	</header>
		<p>
			<li>Topic 1: I am studying digital affordances because I want to find out why digital interactions are so captivating in order to help my reader understand how these interactions are designed for absorption and can have negative impacts.</li>
			<li>Topic 2: I am studying human-machine symbiosis because I want to find out why humans are designing machines with human likenesses in order to help my reader understand the goals and societal implications of such technology.</li>
			<li>Topic 3: I am studying the conflict between digital and physical environments because I want to find out how to integrate experiences in both realities in order to help my reader understand how to design environments where interactions in one reality support the other.</li>
