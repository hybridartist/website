		<h4>Abstract</h4>

		<p>
			Today we spend much of our personal and professional lives in complex built environments that lack distinctive characteristics to intuitively navigate our way around. Simultaneously we spend an increasing amount of time in virtual environments and depend on digital tools for wayfinding in physical spaces. The proliferation of digital devices in our spaces, and diminished situation awareness that comes with their use, is stoking conflict between physical and virtual worlds. The introduction of mixed reality, a continuum of environments between reality and virtual reality, poses new challenges for interactions in both our physical and virtual worlds - the most crucial being our ability to find our way.

			In this thesis I research, design, and implement a system of wayfinding in mixed reality environments. The project leverages cues from nature to provide a more intuitive wayfinding user experience across physical and digital objects that coexist and interact. Cognitive mapping, contextual inquiry, and rapid prototyping techniques are used to achieve a more human-centered design of mixed reality experiences. While this case study is in a university setting, the findings may benefit other environments where wayfinding can be mission-critical such as airports and hospitals.

			I recently had the chance to play around with a Leica M9 35mm rangefinder camera. While it's a digital camera it has an old-school feel - looking through the camera you see two images of the same subject and need to calibrate the wheel until both images fuse into one in order to focus.

			This control mechanism felt pretty intuitive and was interesting to see that it hasn't changed much while many other aspects of photography have dramatically changed with digital technology. I thought back to my main problem of perceived crowding from digital objects in virtual reality - what if you could easily control the distance of objects in your field of view in a head-mounted display?

			While I don't intend to move forward with the design of a hardware solution at this time, I sketched out some ideas to better understand what this experience might be like. Perhaps they could be implemented in software with a zoom functionality or custom visual settings, both of which are available in most mobile devices but not currently in HMDs and I belive would greatly improve usability.
