<p>Final prototype and presentation.</p>

			I came in to MAGNET over the weekend believing this would be a good time with less foot traffic to test prototypes in context. I set up halfway down the west hallway where there is a node of intersecting paths - or where one nondescript hallway crosses another nondescript hallway. It turned out there was an event hosted by the New York Paleontological Society with many visitors to MAGNET who were unfamiliar with the space and mostly 50+ age range. I found that exact spot to be troublesome for many visitors and got asked for directions many times which was helpful for my research.

			I created two prototypes in an attempt to simulate a mixed reality experience in the real environment and virtual environment. These prototypes were building upon my previous work using wayfinding cues from nature such as the sun and stars.

			In the first prototype I used physical objects in the space to test out these natural wayfinding symbols in a tangible way. I placed a string of Christmas lights in the middle of the hallway to create a path of stars and attached a bright orange construction safety flag to a nearby hand sanitizer stand to create a ‘sun’ that would symbolize the destination. I found the presence of physical objects in the real environment to be very different from a simulation of mixed reality, perhaps they are too high-fidelity to test digital concepts.

			The second prototype was another attempt at creating a head-mounted display to test wayfinding symbols overlaid on a person’s field of view. I found a reindeer antler headband in the dollar store that had sturdy plastic underneath the felt antlers. I cut away the felt, attached adjustable gear ties, and used binder clips to hang a clear piece of vellum. Unfortunately this too was not able to achieve enough distance from the eyes for the image to be clear.

			There is still a gap between experiences and I did not find either to be a successful way to prototype or test ideas in context. I sketched out the idea of a 3D prototype diorama that might provide for rapid prototyping in context to understand user information needs as they move about the real environment.

			I received helpful feedback from Nick on my presentation. He pointed out the cadence of presenting the slides is important and that I should set up each concept first before moving to the next image which could distract the audience. He also suggested some changes in the order of presenting ideas to structure a more cohesive narrative.
