		<h4>Escape Your Head with User Testing</h4>
	</header>
		<p>
			My target user group for testing was first-time visitors to MAGNET. The plan was to give them a navigational task and see how well they responded to directional cues given from prototypes. It proved to be difficult for me to recruit participants in this short period of time. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Another target user group I had in mind was first responders since they need to navigate quickly to help in an emergency situation. I interviewed a Fire Academy student at City College of San Francisco to better understand navigational methods firefighters use to find their way in indoor environments.
		</p>
		<p>
			I learned that first of all it’s important for firefighters to be familiar with the buildings in their community or protection area. They visit buildings under normal conditions to develop a cognitive map of its layout to refer to in case of emergency in the future. 
		</p>
		<p>
			When responding to an emergency, firefighters do not use cardinal directions such as North and South to navigate within a building. They assign the street entrance as Alpha, and from there clockwise assign Bravo, Charlie, and Delta sides of the building.

		</p>
		<p>
			Once inside, firefighters rely on all sensory input to navigate since smoke often limits visibility.They listen for sounds from victims and pay attention to tactile feedback to avoid dangerous areas. Left hand search or right hand search are techniques where a firefighter crawls on the floor keeping one hand on the wall to orient themselves and the other hand extends to feel around the environment and search for victims.

		</p>
		<p>
			Thermal imaging devices detect the relative heat of objects and can be used to spot victims through smoke. These devices are still expensive and not always available.

		<h4>Reading, Reviewing and Reflecting</h4>
	</header>
		<p>
			In <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=551594" target ="blank">Becoming Virtual: Reality in the Digital Age</a>, Pierre Levy takes a look at the impact of virtualization beyond communication to our bodies, economic activities, and collective intelligence. This book provides an insightful theoretical framework for my research and the relationship between virtual and physical worlds. 
		</p>
		<p>
			By strictly defining what it means to be virtual he identifies parallels in human history and other species. “The process of virtualization that disengages us from a specific environment did not begin with the human species. It is inscribed in history, in life. According to Josef Reichholf, from the most primitive single-cell creatures up through birds and mammals, improvements in locomotion have introduced ‘increasingly larger spaces and more abundant possibilities of existence for living beings’ (Reichholf 1994, 222). The invention of new velocities is the first degree of virtualization.” (Levy 1998, 37-38).
		</p>
		<p>
			I found this philosophical perspective to really expand the way I think about the possibilities for mixed reality as well as potential social responses to it. What does it mean to have a collective intelligence, a collective hyperbody? How can we design solutions for the impacts of deterritorialization and the shift from interior to exterior and exterior to interior?

		<h4>Abstract</h4>
	</header>
		<p>
			  Today we live, work, and recreate in complex built environments that lack distinctive characteristics to intuitively navigate our way around. Simultaneously we spend an increasing amount of time in virtual environments, and the proliferation of digital devices in our spaces are stoking conflict between physical and virtual worlds. The introduction of mixed reality (MR) into our environment poses new challenges to our interactions in our physical and virtual realities, the most crucial being our ability to navigate in this new environment. In this thesis I research and develop a system of wayfinding design in MR environments. This work will provide a holistic view of wayfinding across digital and tangible experiences and inform the design of wayfinding strategies. The development of MR rapid prototyping techniques will promote the human-centered design of MR applications. While this case study is in a university setting, the findings may benefit other MR environments such as airports and hospitals where wayfinding can be mission-critical.
