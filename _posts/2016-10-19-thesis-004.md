		<h4>Prototype Exploration and Iteration</h4>
	</header>
		<p>
			This week I created a prototype to envision a mixed reality experience embedded in the physical space at MAGNET. I chose to navigate to Room 822, commonly referred to as the "Black Box", where the VR lab is located and often hosts events where visitors from outside NYU need to ask the guard at the desk for directions since they only know the event takes place in the Black Box.

		</p>
		<p>
			I used neon green duct tape to create wayfinding signs as well as an illuminated path on the floor.When a visitor arrives at the 8th floor elevator lobby, they would see a sign for Room 822 and an arrow pointing them to the east entrance.

		</p>
		<p>
			An illuminated path on the floor would trace the route to the south, all the way down the non-descript hallway to the end where Room 822 is located.

		</p>
		<p>
			I experimented with arrows and chevrons on the walls but the path on the ground was the most noticeable and direct.

			Parinita is a graduate student in computer science and works as a guard at the MAGNET entrance. Not only did she graciously put up with my duct taping the lobby, she answered my informal interview on traffic flow at MAGNET and provided helpful feedback on my prototype.

			She said many visitors have a hard time finding their way around the space and frequently ask her for directions to the faculty offices, to a VR event simply listed as at the "Black Box", or to the restrooms. I was surprised to hear many people had difficulty finding the restrooms, and she said when she shows them the way and points out the iconography on the wall they mention they would never have seen it since it's to the side and not in front of them.

			Another telling example from her experience was the number of people who can't figure out that they need to push a button to exit through the doors even though there's a large sign indicating "Press here to EXIT". Because of this, her feedback on my prototype was that the illuminated path would probably be more helpful since it's directly in front of them while the arrows are to the side of a person's field of view.

		<h4>Reflection</h4>
	</header>
		<p>
			Prototyping with objects in the physical space proved to be a very effective way of visualizing the experience in context and soliciting feedback. The illuminated path on the floor was much more effective than the arrows or chevrons on the walls - there's no processing of symbols required of the user, just follow the direction of the line. Yet the bright neon green path is so straightforward that it seems a bit heavy-handed for a pedestrian experience and might be better suited for biking and driving where you're moving faster and require precision to stay in your lane. In future iterations I would like to make this experience not call so much attention from the rest of the environment and guide the user in a more pleasant way.
