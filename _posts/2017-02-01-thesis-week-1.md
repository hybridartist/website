<p>Reframing my research question.</p>

			This week I conducted contextual research and reframed my research question to create my first thesis presentation. I looked back at the virtuality continuum and realized my original project was focused on the augmented reality space and tied to assumptions about wearables. Looking at the bigger picture I realized we have achieved many aspects of ubiquitous computing and are rapidly approaching environments in augmented virtuality. This is also reflected in market research outside of the academic ivory tower.

		<p>
			Ubiquitous computing is a concept where computing can be done anywhere and from any device rather than sitting at a desktop computer demanding your full attention. Since this original vision was articulated by Mark Weiser in the late 1980s, today’s computers are much smaller and mobile and are taking over our bodies and our environment. The proliferation of wearables and the Internet of Things poses new challenges for designers who need to consider the user experience not just with a particular product or service but rather with a broader digital ecosystem. <strong>How might we advocate for users in the design of ubiquitous computing environments?</strong> In this thesis I propose to research and develop frameworks for user advocacy in the design of ubiquitous computing environments. By conducting interviews with designers, strategists, and other stakeholders I aim to uncover insights most relevant for the human-centered design of these systems and visualize them for accessible use by practitioners in the field.

			In our Thesis Accountability meeting, Tatiana raised a good point about looking into the opposite of the movement toward making everything “smart”. I realize I have a lot more contextual research to do now that I have pivoted my research area and need to back it up.
