			Based on my findings from my smart home case study and user testing, I believed the activity theory framework needed to be adapted to better suit the task of informing the design process. One of the advantages of Engestrom’s original Activity System Model is that it can be applied to structure many human activities. However this framework is very broad and appears to be ideal for a higher unit of analysis for computer-supported collaborative work (CSCW) than what is needed in the design of individual human-computer interactions.

			As Rogers (2008) puts it:
			<blockquote cite="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0953543807000616">The main weakness [Gonzalez, 2006] describes is one of interpretation: researchers find it notoriously difficult to decide whether something should be labeled as a top level activity or as a lower level action. For example, completing a software project can be considered as a top level activity while programming a module is considered as an action. But, equally, programming a module can be viewed as an activity. AT does not present a clear methodological prescription for analysts to decide on the selection of levels which makes it frustrating to use.</blockquote>

			This was demonstrated in my smart home case study where the findings under ‘Division of Labor’ did not contribute much actionable contextual information towards the design. Here’s the case study in version 1:

			I believe an important missing piece in capturing the context of an interaction to be the affordances and constraints of the physical environment. The relationships between objects in context, as well as factors in the natural and built environment, have an impact on human activity and are important considerations for the design of interactions. Here’s v2 with the inclusion of ‘Environment’:

			I tested out my adapted framework by updating my smart home case study. I believe the findings under ‘Environment’ to be much more informative for design purposes. The original framework did not provide the structure to include these ethnographic findings, whereas the updated version provides a richer understanding of the user’s context.

		<h4>User Testing</h4>
	</header>
		<p>
			I had the opportunity to test out my v2 prototype with 35 UX researchers at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/NYC-UX-User-Researchers-Meetup/events/237865845/" target ="blank">NYC UX/User Researcher Meetup</a>. First I gave a talk on an overview of mixed reality environments, the technologies enabling them today, and my research on approaches to making them more human-centered. I presented my smart home case study and how ethnographic methods allowed me to capture rich data in context, and how my adapted activity theory framework provided a great way to structure my findings that can inform future design enhancements. 
		</p>
		<p>
			After the talk we had an interactive workshop where I gave three mixed reality scenarios and researchers worked in groups to come up with research approaches for their scenario of choice. Printed copies of my activity system were on the tables in case groups wanted to use it. Almost immediately one person was overwhelmed and confused by it and desperately asking what they were supposed to do with it. Many groups ignored it while they discussed technical constraints in their scenarios and research methods they were more familiar with. At the end when each team shared their approaches I asked if it was different working with a mixed reality scenario and there was consensus that it was very different.

		<h4>Draft of Results</h4>
	</header>
		<p>
			Out of 35 users the majority did not actively engage with the system during their team research planning. However after the workshop, 5 people I will call ‘super users’ took copies of the system with them and it really resonated with them. What the super users had in common was they already had some background in order to understand the system’s value - either they were familiar with the theoretical side or they had experience in the mixed reality space. One had a background in cognitive science and this system reminded him of distributed cognition so he recognized this way of analyzing human activity through ethnographic methods and use of tools. Another was working on an Internet of Things project for a client.
		</p>
		<p>
			Key findings: 
				<li>The design of the document is not approachable or easy to understand.</li>
				<li>The system requires more thorough explanation/onboarding before use.</li>
				<li>The system is more suitable for the synthesis phase rather than at the outset of a project.</li>

		<h4>Meeting Notes</h4>
	</header>
		<p>
			In this week’s meeting with my Thesis Advisor we discussed developing another case study to demonstrate how my activity system would work across a range of mixed reality environments. I made arrangements to use the Microsoft HoloLens to build out my second case study.

		<p>
			I had another “Thesis Hack Day” with my Thesis Accountability Partners where I was able to draft several pages on my user testing and results.
