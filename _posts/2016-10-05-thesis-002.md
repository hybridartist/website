			I picked three topics and created three concepts for each. The colors represent which concepts I pushed forward: green for visual synthesis and blue for prototyping.

		<h4>Visual Synthesis</h4>
	</header>
		<p>
			I selected three concepts to move forward into visual synthesis:
				<li>UX across environments and devices: problems and solutions for integrating information from HMD, screens, walls, IoT?</li>
				<li>What would experiences in nature look like with ubiquitous computing technology? How might it enhance our experience to unplug/go off the grid?</li>
				<li>Therapeutic responsive environments - multi-sensory mixed-reality experience to bring nature into everyday settings</li>
		</p>
		<p>
			I began by sketching the concepts, then searched for images that represented various components of each concept. I organized the images into mind maps using Coggle, a helpful but unfortunately-named tool.

			Creating the mind maps made me realize some concepts were going to be harder to develop than others, so I decided to keep only one of those concepts for prototyping. Here are the three concepts for prototyping:
			<li>Concept 1: digital touchpoints in physical spaces</li>
			<li>Concept 2: UX across environments and devices</li>
			<li>Concept 3: ubiquitous computing interactions</li>

		<h4>Reflection</h4>
	</header>
		<p>
			Doing visual synthesis and prototyping, and having time to delve into each step over a week each, really helped me to get more specific about my research questions and push my ideas further. Creating the mind maps made me realize some concepts were going to be harder to develop than others, so I decided to keep only one of those concepts for prototyping. I liked making prototypes this early on in the process to test out ideas in a tangible way and communicate them to get better feedback from others. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I found myself to be most interested in the goggle prototype and further pursuing the concept of UX across environments in this way. The context-aware screen idea proved to be an issue that I care about but don’t see much opportunity to make an impact - it seems inevitable that screens are going to continue to pop up everywhere and owned by large corporations that are hard to pin down responsibility. The smart window was very straightforward that there didn’t seem to be much room to explore further.
