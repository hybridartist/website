		<h4>Question and Statement</h4>
	</header>
		<p>
			Question: How might we design a more natural system of wayfinding in mixed reality environments?
		</p>
		<p>
			Statement: I am studying wayfinding in mixed reality because I want to find out how to create a more natural wayfinding experience in order to help my reader understand how to design wayfinding systems that integrate physical and virtual environments.

		<h4>Prototype Journey</h4>

			 A look back at the prototypes I've made thus far.

			 This week I was inspired by elements in nature used by animals and humans in history to navigate. Sea turtles are born on the beach with an innate ability to navigate, using the light from the stars and sun to go to the water and then using magnetic fields to navigate in the ocean.

			 As part of my research this week I played around with Google Tilt Brush to get more familiar with experiencing virtual environments with a HMD. I learned elements close to the eyes hurt after a while, even in the periphery it can get claustrophobic, and since each brush stroke I created was within arms length of me I could only escape using the ‘teleport’ feature and stop painting. Meanwhile the stars in the background attracted my attention without imposing on my vision from a comfortable distance and in cool colors.

		<p>
			 I created a few different prototypes with various combinations of elements such as landmarks, paths, and edges.
		</p>
		<p>
			I started with a navigational North Star

			Adding a night sky as an edge
			<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/006-north-star-sky.png" alt="" style="width:100%;height:auto;">
			And guiding stars as a path
			<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/006-north-star-sky-path.png" alt="" style="width:100%;height:auto;">
			Here's just the stars as landmarks
			<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/006-north-star-path.png" alt="" style="width:100%;height:auto;">
			I also imagined a turtle navigating to the sun
			<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/006-sunrise.png" alt="" style="width:100%;height:auto;">
			With the beach as a path
			<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/006-sunrise-sand.png" alt="" style="width:100%;height:auto;">
			And a shore line for an edge
			<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/006-sunrise-shore-sand.png" alt="" style="width:100%;height:auto;">
			Here's a look at just the beach path and shore edge

			<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/006-shore.png" alt="" style="width:100%;height:auto;">
		</p>
		<p>
			Also I read an article recently that imagined an MR environment would enable you to have a red carpet roll out in front of you wherever you go. I thought this was funny since red carpets in real life function as navigational aids. Creating a digital red carpet experience seems much less satisfying - the color is garish and alarming in a digital context where red usually signifies error or emergency. This version is quite the opposite of my natural prototypes since many animals can see ultraviolet (UV) light and can’t see colors at the upper end of the human visible spectrum such as oranges and reds.

		<h4>Propose a Solution</h4>
	</header>
		<p>
			My proposed solution would incorporate elements from nature into a wayfinding system aided by additional symbolic elements as needed.

		<h4>Questions for Discussion</h4>
	</header>
		<p>
			<li>In which environments or contexts would this seem most and least helpful?</li>
			<li>Where does my proposed solution fall in the range of subtle/loud, integrated/imposed?</li>
			<li>Which elements seem most and least effective? (paths, landmarks, edges)</li> 
			<li>What elements are missing? (directional symbols, distance, map, route overview)</li>
			<li>Are there quick ways to build and test working prototypes for HMDs?</li>
		</p>

		<h4>Reflection</h4>
	</header>
		<p>
			Exploring natural cues in the environment was a really important step to find alternatives from the symbols on signs and computer screens we’ve gotten used to. My experience in VR really put in perspective the UX issues at stake in working with HMDs and how overwhelming it can feel being surrounded by computer-generated graphics. I believe this week’s prototypes fill in a space in the spectrum of subtle/loud and integrated/imposed, deliberately exploring the more subtle for now since it’s easy to crank up the graphics. Feedback this week was especially helpful since as the vision for this prototype increases in fidelity the harder it is to step back from as the designer and I need to rely on impartial observations from others. I look forward to continuing the exploration of natural elements and incorporating some important symbolic elements that are needed.
