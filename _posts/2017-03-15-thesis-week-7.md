		<h4>Feedback Synthesis</h4>
	</header>
		<p>
			Demo night provided a refreshing opportunity to talk with designers in the field from different disciplines. It had the added benefit of forcing me to deliver and iterate on my pitch 8 times in a row and I have a better sense of how to talk about my project. Most designers found the activity system would be useful to map out the context in which interactions are taking place and use that framework to inform their design. However, several found the template difficult to use on its own because the theory itself is broad and each area could use more design-specific instructions.

		<h4>Research Participants</h4>

		<p>
			I compiled a list of designers and researchers working on smart home technologies and started reaching out to them for interviews. Unfortunately, the response rate was low and I discovered why - many designers have signed NDAs and cannot discuss what they’re working on. At first this was a frustrating roadblock but I realized on the other hand it is an opportunity. If designers of smart home technologies are not talking to each other, it supports my hypothesis that designers are more concerned with the design of their particular product than the design of a human-centered experience of integrated technologies and spaces. I’ve readjusted my primary research plan accordingly and am excited by the new direction.

		<h4>Research Locations</h4>

			I reached out to smart home showrooms in NYC to conduct research on site. I’m excited that one company agreed to filming the customer experience in the showroom as well as an off-camera interview. This method of observation by participating in a service is called a “service safari” by service designers, and I’ve found it to be a powerful way to understand the user journey, service touchpoints, and context in which the interactions are taking place. This approach broadens my research participants to include retailers, installers, and potential customers.

			This week I had a full-day “Thesis Hackathon” with my Thesis Accountability Partners. Tatiana scheduled our work following the pomodoro technique and I was happy with the work we did and our periodic check-ins.
