			I met with Kate to discuss research methods and I believe primary research in the form of interviews will be the best approach. Presenting a few detailed case studies of smart users in their homes will show use cases and user journeys, and interviewing subject matter experts will illuminate the current state of the field. We discussed surveys but the qualitative data I’m after is not easily answered in this format nor does it require a larger sample size of users.
