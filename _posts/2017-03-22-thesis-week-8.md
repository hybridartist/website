		<h4>Project Details Draft</h4>
	</header>
		<p>
			This week it was helpful to draft my project details and review my process from the beginning. The recent setbacks in the execution of my research plan have been frustrating and reviewing all the work I’ve done thus far is helping me realign the changes in my research plan to my original research objectives. 
		</p>
		<p>
			My research has always revolved around the integration of real and virtual environments. At the outset of my thesis, my research objectives were to provide a conceptual framework and design guidelines for a system of wayfinding design in mixed reality environments. However after receiving feedback at the final presentation and having the chance to take a step back and reflect on the project over the break, I felt stuck making too many assumptions about head-mounted displays. The experience focused on 1x1 interactions with a device rather than the integration of digital and physical objects experienced together in context. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Thus my shift to ubiquitous computing environments and looking at interactions with Internet of Things systems. To narrow the scope of my thesis I was pressed to pick an environment to start somewhere and smart homes seemed to be a place where I could explore this and the user is usually also the person who purchases and maintains the system rather than having to consider a range of stakeholders.
		</p>
		<p>
			Inventory of things that have not changed:
		</p>
		<p>
			<ul>Problem: The introduction of mixed reality, a continuum of environments between reality and virtual reality, poses new challenges for interactions in both our physical and virtual worlds.</ul>
			<li>Previously focused on augmented reality and HMDs</li>
			<li>Now shifted to ubiquitous computing environments and IoT</li>
			<li>Both fall within ‘mixed reality’ in the middle of the virtuality continuum</li>
			<ul>Audience: designers and technologists in order to inform usability in their designs</ul>
			<ul>Ideology: human-centered design and usability</ul>
			<ul>Project objectives: provide a conceptual framework and design guidelines</ul>
			<ul>Methods: interviews, observations, rapid prototyping (as a tool to solicit feedback)</ul>
			<ul>Deliverable: design guidelines. Previously did not define the format, current idea is “smart design toolkit” available free online</ul>

		<h4>Meeting Notes</h4>
	</header>
		<p>
			I met with Dr. Lee, my Human Factors professor who has been familiar with my thesis project since last semester when my focus was on wayfinding in mixed reality environments. We discussed the pivots in my project since then and my need to bring all my work together conceptually regardless of the information delivery system. He offered to review my work and suggested that activity theory may still be involved in the solution.
