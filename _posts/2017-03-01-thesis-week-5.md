		<h4>Meeting Notes</h4>

		<p>
			In this week’s Thesis Accountability Partner meeting we discussed methodologies for my project since I missed last week’s class on it. A literature review from a sociological perspective will provide background on domestic spaces and the history of domestic technologies to understand the difference between smart homes and previous appliances. I will use ethnography for observations in smart home users’ home environments to understand their use of domestic technologies, reliance on automation, division of labor for housework, etc. User-centered design methods such as open-ended interviews and contextual inquiry with smart home users in their homes will allow me to understand their user journey and pain points interacting with various products and services.
