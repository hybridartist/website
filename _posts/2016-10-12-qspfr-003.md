<p>Iteration on prototypes and expanded research.</p>

		<h4>Prototype Exploration and Iteration</h4>
	</header>
		<p>
			This week I created two different prototypes - one paper, and one interactive.
		</p>
		<p>
			I was stuck trying to think of another simple 2D way to test my idea. I realized I needed to have a better idea of the user journey in order to envision what the experience would be like. I created a storyboard of a visitor arriving at the MAGNET elevator lobby and trying to navigate her way to the main lecture hall, or "red room". From these sketches the user experience and features of the interface begin to take shape.

			I created a MAGNET welcome sign with an augmented reality code embedded in it. I posted the sign in the elevator lobby on a wall where room numbers and arrows are painted as part of the existing wayfinding system. A visitor can use their mobile phone to scan the code and see an augmented reality overlay of the floor map and a tip that the lecture hall/"red room" is room 800.

		<h4>Supporting Research</h4>

			My storyboard is supported by research in <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40327-015-0026-2" target ="blank">Implementing an augmented reality-enabled wayfinding system through studying user experience and requirements in complex environments</a>.

			My mobile augmented reality prototype is supported by research in <a href="http://research.arc.uniroma1.it/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/673/291%20Empler.pdf?sequence=1" target ="blank">Realt√† Aumentata: nuova frontiera del wayfinding</a>.

		<h4>Reflection</h4>
	</header>
		<p>
			I decided to move forward with my augmented reality dashboard concept thinking a dashboard metaphor for a head-mounted display was the equivalent of the desktop metaphor for computers. I started by looking at the design of car dashboards over the decades as well as cockpits and air traffic control rooms. However I didn't feel that this metaphor was accurate since the dashboard reflects the controls of the vehicle itself (product) whereas a head-up display reflects what the driver/pilot needs to focus their attention on (information).

			It was very helpful and encouraging to find more recent research and conduct a comparative analysis on wayfinding in augmented reality. There's a lot of room for improvement in the user experience to have a better integration of virtual and physical environments and imagine possible interactions. I like that approaching this problem from a user experience perspective enables me to explore areas I keep thinking about - if in the near future we will navigate the world with a layer of information over our field of view, how do we integrate information from digital touchpoints in our physical environment such as screens, projectors, interactive kiosks, and service robots?
