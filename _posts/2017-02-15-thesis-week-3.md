			I met 1x1 with Gwen to refine my research question. We did a wheel and spoke exercise where the Internet of Things is at the center and brainstormed various possible questions branching from there. Some of the questions specifically on user advocacy or user experience seemed to be quite limiting in the research approach and outputs. I liked ‘How do we visualize an IoT ecosystem?’ but it’s proposing a solution rather than capturing the real problem. I decided to go with 
			<strong>How do humans fit into new IoT environments?</strong> The goal is to outline ways of thinking about IoT environments in order to challenge technological determinism so that we can make decisions toward a better overall user experience. I then needed to narrow down the scope of the project by choosing a case study environment to demonstrate the theories. This was a tough decision because I’m fascinated by how IoT is changing entire cities, retail spaces and workplaces, the purchasing decisions are made by a complex web of stakeholders and I don’t have the capacity to take on that type of study in my thesis. The smart home provides a more intimate portrait of the daily interactions with these technologies and they are purchased and maintained by the homeowner themselves.I thought comparing today’s smart home to the 1950s American kitchen which also saw rapid technological advancement might lend some insight. Narrowing it down even further I asked, <strong>How do smart home technologies impact domestic labor?</strong> I think this question captures the case study but may need some tweaking to convey the broader picture.

			<a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/WAJDT" target ="blank">The Internet of Things: A Survey</a> provides an overview of the various technologies, potential applications and impact. The most notable risk to users is privacy, even for people who aren’t active ‘users’ of an IoT service.	
			<blockquote cite="https://philpapers.org/rec/WAJDT">Many domestic technologies were initially developed for commercial, industrial and even defence purposes and only later, as manufacturers sought to expand their markets, were they adapted for home use… The automatic washing machine, the vacuum  cleaner and the refrigerator had wide commercial application before being scaled down for use in the home. Electric ranges were used in naval and commercial ships before being introduced to the domestic market. Microwave ovens are a direct descendant of military radar technology and were developed for food preparation in submarines by the US Navy.</blockquote>

			<a href="http://www.jamesmahmudrice.info/Appliances.pdf" target ="blank">Appliances and their impact: the ownership of domestic technology and time spent on household work</a> examines the impact of appliances on food/beverage preparation and cleanup, laundry, grounds care, and household work:
			<blockquote cite="http://www.jamesmahmudrice.info/Appliances.pdf">Our overall conclusion is that owning domestic technology rarely reduces unpaid household work. Indeed, in some cases owning appliances marginally increases the time spent on the relevant task. Nor did we find evidence that the diffusion of these appliances leads to any significant alteration in the traditional gender division of housework tasks. In cases where these contemporary domestic technologies do encourage less household work, it tends to be men who are the beneficiaries.</blockquote>

			<a href="http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~hst306/documents/indust.html" target ="blank">President Eisenhower’s 1961 speech</a> warned the public of the “military-industrial complex” that emerged during his presidency. During wars in the past, companies like Ford would receive a government contract and then go back to the production of consumer goods in peacetime. However in the nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union, projects became more complex and technologically specialized and solidified the partnership between the military and industry.
			<blockquote cite="http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~hst306/documents/indust.html">In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists, and will persist.</blockquote>
			<blockquote cite="http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~hst306/documents/indust.html">Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together.</blockquote>

		<h4>Meeting Notes</h4>
	</header>
		<p>
			In this week’s Thesis Accountability Partner meeting we continued to push each other’s ideas further. I shared the progress I made on the smart home and domestic labor, and both agreed that this was a good way to have a feasible case study to explore my ideas. Fang asked “What is a home?” which I will need to define since many homes now have office spaces of some sort. Tatiana suggested looking at all the different services that are automated/outsourced and described the ways that a friend of hers uses Alexa while taking care of the baby. We began identifying the types of questions that may be asked of us during the thesis defense and want to keep thinking of those questions to be prepared for them.
