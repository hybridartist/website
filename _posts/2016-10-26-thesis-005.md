		<h4>Prototype Exploration and Iteration</h4>
	</header>
		<p>
			This week I wanted to discover more intuitive ways of wayfinding and investigated the way animals navigate. It turns out many organisms can perceive earth’s magnetic field and use that information for orientation. Migratory birds have been studied extensively for their ability to navigate.
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/cryptochrome/" target ="blank">Research</a> suggests a protein called cryptochrome, located in the bird’s eye, detects magnetic fields dependent on the presence of certain wavelengths of light i.e. blue light. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Humans also have cryptochrome and this sensitivity to blue light made me think of other
			<a href="http://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side" target ="blank">research</a> indicating how blue light from CFLs and digital devices is particularly harmful at night throwing off your circadian rhythm and blocking melatonin production… and perhaps our sense of orientation?
		</p>
		<p>
			This illustration was helpful in demonstrating what a bird’s visual field through a magnetic filter might look like.

			For my prototype I decided to try applying this view to orienting in MAGNET.

		<h4>Books</h4>

		<p>
			Image of the City
		</p>
		<p>
			Kevin Lynch wrote this famous book in 1960 which had a dramatic impact on urban planning and environmental psychology. He observed how people take in information about a city and create mental models of their surroundings. These mental maps have five distinct elements: paths, edges, nodes, districts, and landmarks. A city’s “imageability” is composed of physical attributes that contribute to creating a strong mental image of the city, and the clearer the picture the easier to navigate and share the same image with others. He coined the term “wayfinding” as "a consistent use and organization of definite sensory cues from the external environment."
		</p>
		<p>
			Image and Environment
		</p>
		<p>
			Downs and Stea define cognitive mapping as the process in which people acquire, process and store information about their environment. Downs is a geographer and Stea a psychologist, and their interdisciplinary perspective on spatial decision-making had a big impact on the field. The book is edited by them and features a collection of essays by prominent figures such as Edward Tolman and Kevin Lynch. This book lends depth to the spatial cognition and orientation involved in wayfinding.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Wayfinding Handbook: Information Design for Public Places
		</p>
		<p>
			The Wayfinding Handbook by David Gibson provides a graphic design perspective on wayfinding. The book has a lot of great imagery and wayfinding sign examples. It was good to skim through this and appreciate the complex considerations in consistent branding, typography, iconography, materials, and locations for signs in high traffic areas such as museums, transportation hubs, and sports stadiums. The book breaks down the many types of signage including identification, orientation, directional, regulatory signs.
		</p>
		<p>
			Ambient Findability: What We Find Changes Who We Become
		</p>
		<p>
			Peter Morville wrote the O’Reilly book on Information Architecture, a very practical deep dive into the discipline that I appreciated when I was learning it on my own, and in this book he seems to do it again. Morville describes ambient findability as the world we live in today, with the Internet readily available and on the cusp of ubiquitous computing, where any piece of information is findable from anywhere at anytime. He covers the skills that animals and humans use to wander without getting lost and also goes into practical considerations for designing for findability at the system and object level.

		<h4>Reflection</h4>
	</header>
		<p>
			I enjoyed researching animal navigation and discovering that humans have cryptochrome too so we are affected by the earth’s magnetic fields. While my prototype applying how birds might perceive magnetic fields to navigating MAGNET wasn’t very practical it shed light on how important context is. Perhaps seeing patterns in magnetic fields could be more useful for humans traveling in the air where a broader field of view and navigation using cardinal directions is more relevant. Inside a building it’s harder to decipher whether you’re traveling east or south and not always the most useful in finding your destination. I also think trying something this subtle visually demonstrated just how much sensory overload in the environment that the signal would have to compete with. While last week’s iteration was loud, this one was barely noticeable. I think areas for further exploration include affordances in physical space as well as embodiment and non-visual ways to navigate.
