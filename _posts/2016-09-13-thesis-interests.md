<p>This week was all about exploring inspirations and interests.</p>

		<h4>Card Sort</h4>

		<p>
			First was a card sort of inspiration and interests. I needed 15 examples of each, which allowed me to cast my net wide and see patterns.

		<p>
			I ended up skipping part 1, the inspiration cards, and going straight to part 2 and creating interest cards. I've been spending more time thinking about my areas of interest so they came to me more easily. It was important for me to visualize each idea with a sketch so I could easily connect the words with the larger concept and context I had in mind.

			Afterward I went back to the inspiration cards. I started with new media artworks that were so inspiring I remembered them off the top of my head. Then I had to do a lot more research into artists and new work. It was especially difficult to find female new media artists once I noticed most of my cards were men, and mostly white men at that. While itâ€™s not news to me that the art world isn't a representative place, new media art in particular seems to inherit the barriers of both art and technology.

		<h4>Narrowing It Down</h4>

		<p>
			<li>Topic 1: The design of digital interactions affords information overload, attention colonization, and online addiction.</li>
			<li>Topic 2: The desire for human-machine symbiosis propels human adaptation to new technologies: techno-fetishism, digitally-mediated relationships and redefined social capital.</li>
			<li>Topic 3: Digital experiences are in direct conflict with our awareness of and interaction in the physical environment.</li>
