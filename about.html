								Hi! I'm Shannon Holloway, a researcher and designer based in Brooklyn, NY. 
							<p>
								I'm passionate about solving complex problems with human-centered design methods. I lead interdisciplinary teams to develop high-impact research strategies, translate research findings into actionable insights, design human-centered solutions, and promote knowledge sharing. I'm a self-starter with 8+ years of experience realizing new initiatives in industry, academia, and government.
							</p>
							<p>
								I received my M.S. from New York University Tandon School of Engineering in Integrated Digital Media and my B.A. from the University of California at Berkeley in the Practice of Art. I'm a <a href="http://www.jamesdysonfoundation.com/" target="blank">James Dyson Design Leader</a> and member of the <a href="https://www.hfes.org">Human Factors and Ergonomics Society</a>, the <a href="http://www.edra.org/">Environmental Design Research Association</a>, and <a href="http://dfanyu.com/" target="blank">Design for America NYU</a>. 
							</p> 
							<p>
								In my free time I enjoy working on my own artistic and DIY projects, riding my bike and getting lost in a good sci-fi novel.
