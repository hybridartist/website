								Hi! I'm Shannon Holloway, a designer and researcher based in Brooklyn, NY.
							</p>
							<p>
								I'm passionate about solving complex problems with human-centered design methods. I enjoy each phase of the process - discovering unmet user needs, synthesizing research findings into actionable insights, and designing innovative and feasible design solutions fit for human use.
							</p>
							<p>
								I received my BA from the University of California at Berkeley and am currently pursuing an MS at New York University Tandon School of Engineering in Integrated Digital Media. I'm a <a href="http://www.jamesdysonfoundation.com/" target="blank">James Dyson Design Leader</a> and member of the <a href="https://www.hfes.org">Human Factors and Ergonomics Society</a>. the <a href="http://www.edra.org/">Environmental Design Research Association</a>. and <a href="http://dfanyu.com/" target="blank">Design for America NYU</a>. 
							</p> 
							<p>
								In my free time I enjoy working on my own artistic and DIY projects, riding my bike or getting lost in a good sci-fi novel.
