								Hi! I'm Shannon Holloway, a User Experience (UX) Researcher based in the San Francisco Bay Area.
							<p>
								I'm passionate about solving complex problems with human-centered design methods. I lead interdisciplinary teams to develop high-impact and inclusive research strategies, translate research findings into actionable insights, and deliver delightful user experiences.
							</p>
							<p>
								At <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/about/our-company/" target="blank">Google</a>, I drive broad inclusive research initiatives across <a href="https://gsuite.google.com/" target="blank">G Suite</a> products to further Google's mission to "organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful".
							</p>
							<p>
								I received my M.S. from <a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/" target="blank">New York University Tandon School of Engineering</a> in Integrated Digital Media and my B.A. from the <a href="http://art.berkeley.edu/" target="blank">University of California at Berkeley</a> in the Practice of Art.
							</p>
							<p>
								In my free time, you can find me exploring California's natural wonders, working on artistic projects, or getting lost in a good sci-fi novel.
